For this project, I collaborated with KIKO and utilized ChatGPT as a tool to bring the concept of a 
Spotify search engine to life. My role focused on creating the access key needed to retrieve data 
from the Spotify API, while KIKO worked on container sizing and the arrangement of the search results.
This was our first experience working with an API that required an access token. Once we obtained 
CLIENT access to the API, we turned to YouTube and Google for troubleshooting, refining the code 
until it met our expectations. 

Initially, the wireframe was designed with a mobile approach, but it didn’t translate well when viewed 
on a desktop. After experimenting with placements, sizing, and other details, we decided on a 
grid layout for better aesthetics. We then used ChatGPT to convert the initial pixel-based designs 
into REMs, ensuring consistency across different devices. 

After that, we made our search results interactive, allowing users to choose a song to learn more about
it. The other search results smoothly disappear and an embedded preview of the selected song is 
displayed for users to listen to. Since I am the "client" with the Spotify developer account (with 
premium), the full song plays with scrubbing features using the Spotify Web Player SDK.

Our project is geared up for further tweaks and exciting development beyond this course. 
Implementing the API turned out to be less challenging than I initially thought. Thanks to handy 
resources like Spotify’s dev tools (and Youtube, haha), we were able to create something truly useful 
and insightful.
